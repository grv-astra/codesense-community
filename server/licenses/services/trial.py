"""Trial gate: cap the number of successfully-completed scans per type -- code
(SAST) and SBOM each get their OWN counter/limit, so using up one doesn't
consume the other's allowance.

Enabled only when ``TRIAL_MODE=true`` (off by default, so normal/production
deployments are unlimited). The counts live in a single monotonic ``TrialUsage``
row — independent of the (hard-deletable) Scan/SbomScan rows — so a client
cannot reset the trial by deleting scans. Enforcement is server-side; the UI
count is UX.

Counting policy: a slot is consumed only on SUCCESSFUL completion
(``record_completion`` is called from each pipeline's completion step, which
failed scans never reach). In-progress/queued/interrupted scans of a given
type are counted against THAT type's limit at creation time (and while
pending resume) so concurrent submissions can't overshoot the cap. A
user-cancelled scan does NOT count -- same as a failed one, no slot was ever
completed.
